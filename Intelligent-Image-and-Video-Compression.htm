                <h2>About</h2>
                <p>This book explains the requirements, analysis, design and application of a modern video coding system. It draws on the authors' extensive academic and professional experience in this field to deliver a text that is algorithmically rigorous yet accessible, relevant to modern standards and practical. It builds on a thorough grounding in mathematical foundations and visual perception to demonstrate how modern image and video compression methods can be designed to meet the rate-quality performance levels demanded by today's applications and users, in the context of prevailing network constraints. </p>

                <h2 id="poster">Demonstration Software</h2>
                VISTRA is a demonstration software which provides an interactive overview of the some of the key principles of image and video compression, including:

<ul>
  <li>Spatial and temporal redundancy</li>
  <li>Colour channel subsampling</li>
  <li>JPEG image compression</li>
  <li>DCT transform coding</li>
  <li>Motion compensated video compression</li>
  <li>Motion estimation block matching</li>
</ul>

The software and user manual can be downloaded from <A HREF="VISTRA-IVC.zip">here</A>.

                <b><font SIZE="4">Professor David R. Bull PhD, FIET, FIEEE, CEng </font></b>obtained his BSc from the University of Exeter, his MSc from the University of Manchester and his PhD from the University of Cardiff. He currently holds the Chair in Signal Processing at the University of Bristol. He is head of the Visual Information Laboratory, Director of Bristol Vision Institute and Director of the UK Government's <span>&#163</span>46m MyWorld Strength in Places prgramme. David has worked widely across image and video processing focused on streaming, broadcast and wireless applications. He has published over 600 academic papers, various articles and 3 books and has given numerous invited/keynote lectures and tutorials. He has also received numerous awards including the IEE Ambrose Fleming Premium for his work on Primitive Operator Digital Filters a best Paper Award for his work on Link Adaptation for Video Transmission. David's work has been exploited commercially and he has acted as a consultant for companies and governments across the globe.  In 2001, he co-founded ProVision Communication Technologies Ltd., who launched the world's first robust multi-source wireless HD sender for consumer use. His recent award-winning and pioneering work on perceptual video compression using deep learning, has produced world-leading rate-quality performance.
